## Possible Projects for CS1980 Students

### Industry Projects

These are projects where you will be working directly with a company.  Note - if you end up on an Industry project, your course registration will change to CS1981.  This is an administrative detail and will have no impact on you other than a slightly different number appearing on your transcript.

_NetApp_: TBD (POC: Chuck Heinle)

_Viz_: TBD (POC: Mike Bigrigg)

_Swedish Company_: TBD (POC: Dr. Nina Dzamashvili Fogelström, Blekinge Tekniska Högskola (Blekinge Institute of Technology))

### Faculty Projects

These are projects working with academic faculty, either at the University of Pittsburgh or elsewhere.

_Sterile Compound Training in Augmented/Virtual Reality_: An augmented/virtual reality game for Pharmacy students to learn how to deal with sterile compounding. (POC: Dr. Ravi Patel, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy)

_Pharmacy Quiz Game_: Adding additional features and moving away from Google Ap Engine to new platform (perhaps Docker on AWS?). (POC: Dr. Ravi Patel, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy)

_LensKit Recommendation System_: Provide a web dashboard to show status of a large-scale recommendation engine. (POC: Dr. Michael Ekstrand, Boise State University)

_Cellular Image Analysis_: (NOT DEFINITE YET) Write software for image analysis project assembling a computational pipeline to extract data from live cell movies (POC: Dr. Robin Lee, Computational and Systems Biology at the University of Pittsburgh)

_ASL Dictionary_: Provide a secure dictionary app for American Sign Language 1 and 2 students to use at the University of Pittsburgh. (POC: Debra Hast, Less-Commonly-Taught Languages Center)

### Open-Source Projects

These are projects working with the open-source community.

_Haiku_: Help develop the Haiku operating system, an open-source version of BeOS. Note that there can be multiple groups working on this project, as long as they are working on different ideas (see below for list). (POC: Alex)

Description: Potential ideas - https://www.haiku-os.org/community/gsoc/2016/ideas

_rst_: Develop a requirements tracking tool for developers, in Rust. (POC: Garrett Vitiral)

Details: https://github.com/vitiral/rst

_Linux kernel tinification_: Minimizing the size of the Linux kernel. Note that you will not need in-depth knowledge of Linux kernel internals or of the C language; the POC is OK with teaching these as you go along. (POC: Josh Triplett)

_Servo_: (NOT DEFINITE YET) Helping to implement the new Firefox rendering engine in Rust. (POC: TBD)

_libav_: (NOT DEFINITE YET) Audiovisual encoding/decoding, in C or Rust. (POC: Luca Barbato)
